	Y: Hello. My name is [$name]. Who are you?
	F: Hi[$name]. I'm Faye. 
	Y: Do you live in that house up there?
	F: Yeah, why do you care?
	Y: I was wondering about Brightsage Forest. A... friend... of mine told me about it.
	F: Well, it's just down the path.  
	Y: Are your parents okay with you being this close to the forest? It could be dangerous. Haven't you heard about the blood sucking bats in the area?  
	F: There aren't any bats in the forest. I can handle myself. As for my father, it doesn't matter what he thinks anymore.
	N: She makes an odd expression. 
	Y: Uh... okay, well, be safe. I'm going to check out the forest.
