Gi: Okay, so to get tha fish, ya have to lower ya hook into da water by pressing the "Down Arrow Key".
Gi: Be careful for debris! They will knock ya worm right off!
Gi: Reel ya fish back in when ya've caught it by pressing "Up Arrow Key".
Gi: I've only got 5 worms to give ya right now, so use 'em wisely.
