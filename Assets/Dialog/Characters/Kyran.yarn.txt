K: I just got into Ader today. The locals don't pay any mind, so...
Y: So you just ignore her. Okay...
K: My boy, could I request something of you?
He's clearly avoiding the subject...

K: Like I said, boy, this is the first time I have stepped in this town. How am I supposed to know what this town's norms are?
He's getting a bit scary...

Y: What is it that I need to do?
<<set $q to 1>>
K: It seems that I have forgotten an important duty in Pryshore.
K: There is this beggar that I always feed. I cannot leave Ader for a couple days. Is there any way you can go to Pryshore and feed the gentleman?
Y: Why can't you leave Ader?
K: If I leave, then I risk wasting all of these... fruits. I would appreciate it if you went in my stead.
Y: I don't have any food to give. Any chance I can take him a banana or something?
K: He only eats fish. But it's okay. There is a fisherman named Gilroy in that town. He will help you.

K: A key part you say? Are you sure it's not a decorative piece for some sort of dress? I know many of the femme folk that have decorative metal pieces in their complicated gowns.
Y: Maybe you're right. Have you heard of any other news around town?
K: Not of anything in town persay. I did hear something happening in Fairmount, though.

K: I don't know who that lens belongs to. I'm pretty sure there was a farmer who had lost his glasses at one point. He may still be in Fairmount.

<<set $q to 2>>
Y: Well, I guess I will go to Fairmount
K: Good luck! You will need to cross Blackhall Lake to reach Fairmount. You should reach some more answers there.
