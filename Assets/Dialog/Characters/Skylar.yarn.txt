		Y: Me?" you say.
		S: Yeah. You're [$name], right?
		How the heck did they know that?
		S: Listen, I have something to discuss with you, but it's best done inside.
		You squint.
		S: You can trust me.

		Y: Here are the glasses.

		Y: What happened?
		Skylar grabs your shoulders.
		S: These are the Elder White Mage's goggles! I was right about trusting you!
		I am so confused... This guy... girl?... person... is insane.
		S: It's official. I will join you on your quest to save Ã‰an.
		Skylar has joined your party
		Y: Woah, woah, woah. What?
		S: You're a White Mage, right? Only a White Mage could have rebuilt these.
		Y: I had no knowledge of these things before today!
		S: Then I will provide you with the information you need to succeed.

	S: Hello. Need to know anything?
	Y: Yeah. What's up with the hat?
	S: I rather like it, do you not?
	Y: It's a bit strange...
	S: Well, you're not one to talk of strangeness. You were traveling alone, were you not? It's odd for one of your age to travel by themselves.
	Y: Point taken.
