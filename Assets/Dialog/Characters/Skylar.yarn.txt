		S: Pssst... Hey you!
		Y: Me?
		S: Yes. You're [$name], right?
		T: How did they know that?
		S: Listen, I have something to discuss with you, but it's best done inside.
		N: You squint.
		S: You can trust me.

		Y: Here are the glasses.
		S: I knew it!
		Y: What happened?
		N: Skylar grabs your shoulders.
		S: These are the Elder White Mage's goggles! I was right about trusting you!
		T: I am so confused... This... person... is insane.
		S: You're not a White Mage but... Only a White Mage could have rebuilt these.
		Y: I had no knowledge of this before today!
		S: Then I will provide you with the information you need to succeed.

	S: Hello. Need to know anything?
	Y: Yeah. What's up with the hat?
	S: I rather like it, do you not?
	Y: It's a bit strange...
	S: Well, you're not one to talk of strangeness. You were traveling alone, were you not? It's odd for one of your age to travel by themselves.
	Y: Point taken.

	S: I bet you're wondering how I know your name.
	S: Éan told me.
	Y: Who is that?
	S: It's the girl. Well, it's the name I gave her.
	T: Éan, huh? Suits her well.
	S: I bet you are curious to who I am, right [$name]? Please feel free to call me Skylar.
	Y: What did you want to talk to me about?
	S: I wish to tell you of the past of this land. It may seem peaceful now, but not too long ago, there was a devistating war.
	Y: Doesn't look like there was a war.
	S: Why don't you think so?
	Y: There are no ruins, that I can tell of.
	S: That's because they lie in the forest. It's past Norburn, where no mortal dare lies foot.
	Y: So what happened?
	S: Well, it's a long story. There is a book in here that can go into more detail than I can.
